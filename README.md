## Lessons Learned

This project aims to test all the knowledge acquired trough the Introduction Course from The Odin Project. Using HTML, CSS and JS i created this simple calculator, TOP suggested to avoid using eval() and calc() to do the operation. My solution can be viewed in the script.js file. I also learned how to add Keyboard support to my calculator.  Now, of course there are bugs, it's not a perfect calculator but it will do as a beginner project. Feel free to report the Bugs so that i can try to fix them and in the process learn even more :)
